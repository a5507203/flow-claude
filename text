[FOLLOW-UP REQUEST] User: hi

I'll help coordinate this development session. Let me start by invoking the planner to create the execution plan and initial task branches.

I see the planner has created a simple plan with one task to acknowledge the greeting. Let me now set up the worktree and spawn the worker to execute this task.
[23:11:13] [ORCHESTRATOR] [TOOL] Bash | git worktree add .worktrees/worker-1 task/001-acknowledge-greeting
Now let me spawn the worker to execute the task:

Excellent! The worker has completed the task. Now let me clean up the worktree and invoke the planner for the final report:
[23:13:51] [ORCHESTRATOR] [TOOL] Bash | git worktree remove .worktrees/worker-1
[23:13:51] [ORCHESTRATOR] [TOOL] Task

[23:14:09] [PLANNER] [TOOL] mcp__git__update_plan_branch
Let me clean up the worktree with force and then provide you with the final summary:
[23:14:27] [ORCHESTRATOR] [TOOL] Bash | git worktree remove --force .worktrees/worker-1
[23:14:32] [ORCHESTRATOR] [TOOL] Bash | rm -rf .worktrees/worker-1 && git worktree prune
Perfect! The session has been completed successfully. Here's a summary:

---

## 👋 Hello!

Thank you for your greeting! The system is now operational and ready to assist you with your work.

### Session Complete

I've successfully acknowledged your greeting and confirmed that the system is ready. The development orchestration system is fully functional with:

- ✅ **Planner agent** - Ready to create execution plans
- ✅ **Worker agents** (3 available) - Ready for parallel task execution
- ✅ **Git workflow** - Branch management and worktree isolation configured
- ✅ **Session tracking** - Session ID: session-20251110-231012

### What's Next?

I'm ready to help you with any tasks you'd like to work on, such as:
- Development work on the ICML 2030 conference website
- Code reviews or refactoring
- Feature implementation
- Bug fixes
- Documentation
- Or anything else you have in mind!

Just let me know what you'd like to work on, and I'll coordinate the planning and execution for you. 🚀
[FOLLOW-UP] Injecting: how are you

Hello! I'm doing well, thank you for asking! 😊

I'm fully operational and ready to help you with any development tasks you need. The orchestration system is running smoothly with all agents standing by.

Since this is a friendly conversation rather than a development task, I don't need to spin up the full planning and execution workflow. But I'm here and ready whenever you have:

- Code to write or review
- Features to implement
- Bugs to fix
- Questions about your project
- Or any other development work

Feel free to share what you'd like to work on, and I'll coordinate the team to get it done efficiently! Is there anything specific you'd like help with today?
yes
